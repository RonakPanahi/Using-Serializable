# Using-Serializable

This is a small sample project which I used object serialization in.
Bellow there is a good description...


"Serialization is the conversion of an object to a series of bytes, 
so that the object can be easily saved to persistent storage or 
streamed across a communication link. The byte stream can then be 
deserialized - converted into a replica of the original object." [1]
